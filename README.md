# Kangaroo-Detection
In this repository, I use multiple techniques to improve the performance of a single class object detection(Kangaroo) with a small dataset.

Using YOLOv4 from https://github.com/miemie2013/Keras-YOLOv4/ repository.

Also inspired from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/blob/master/mrcnn/utils.py for mAP calculations
